# RDS-Secret-Rotation

🔐 Automating RDS Credential Rotation with AWS Secrets Manager and Lambda using AWS Cloudformation🔐



In today's cloud security landscape, automating credential rotation is essential. I've streamlined our RDS instance setup using AWS CloudFormation, Secrets Manager, and Lambda for robust security and operational efficiency.




🌟 Key Features:




🔄 Credential Rotation: Our credentials are automatically rotated every week, ensuring continuous security without manual intervention.




🔧 Custom Lambda Function: I've implemented a custom Lambda function to orchestrate the rotation process, offering flexibility and specific business logic integration.




🔍 Why Lambda?

Using Lambda allows us to tailor our rotation logic precisely, including additional steps beyond built-in capabilities, and supports a wider range of use cases.



🔐 Secrets Manager Integration: AWS Secrets Manager securely stores and manages our RDS credentials, ensuring compliance and ease of access.



🌐 Benefits: Automating this process enhances our security posture, reduces human error, and ensures our systems are always up to date with the latest credentials.
